    "# 1.Descriptive Statistics: Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe the characteristics of a data set. This type of statistics includes measures of central tendency (such as mean, median, and mode), measures of variability (such as range and standard deviation), and graphical representations (such as histograms and box plots).\n",
    "## Example: A researcher might use descriptive statistics to summarize the responses to a survey by calculating the average age of the participants, the percentage of male and female respondents, and the range of scores on a particular question.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2.Inferential Statistics: Inferential statistics are used to make inferences about a population based on sample data. This type of statistics involves probability theory and hypothesis testing to determine whether a particular result is statistically significant or due to chance.\n",
    "## Example: A medical researcher might use inferential statistics to determine whether a new drug is more effective than an existing drug by conducting a randomized controlled trial and comparing the results of the two groups. They would use inferential statistics to determine whether the difference in outcomes is statistically significant or due to chance."

Different levels of measurement require different methods of analysis. If we use an incorrect statistical measure or technique for a variable, it can lead to inaccurate or misleading results.\n",

We cannot calculate the mean or median, as the nominal data has no inherent order or distance between categories. On the other hand, if the data is at the interval level, we can use measures of central tendency such as the mean or median, as well as measures of dispersion like standard deviation."

A box plot displays the distribution of data through five key values: the minimum value, the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, and the maximum value. The box represents the middle 50% of the data, with the bottom of the box indicating the first quartile and the top of the box indicating the third quartile. The line inside the box represents the median. The whiskers extend from the box to the minimum and maximum values, respectively."

It provides a quantitative summary of the dataset, including measures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median, mode), measures of dispersion (e.g., standard deviation, range, variance), and graphical representations such as histograms, box plots, or scatter plots. Descriptive statistics are useful for giving an overview of the data, identifying patterns, and making comparisons between groups.\n",
    "## For example, a survey of salaries of employees in a company can be analyzed using descriptive statistics to calculate the average salary, the range of salaries, and the standard deviation of salaries. A histogram or a box plot can also be used to visualize the distribution of salaries in the company.\n",

It involves using probability theory and statistical models to generalize from a sample to a larger population. Inferential statistics can help researchers to make predictions, test hypotheses, and make informed decisions.\n",
    "## For example, a study on the effectiveness of a new medication can be analyzed using inferential statistics to determine if the medication is more effective than a placebo. This involves selecting a sample of participants and randomizing them into two groups: one receiving the medication and the other receiving a placebo. By comparing the outcomes of the two groups, inferential statistics can be used to determine if the medication has a significant effect on the population at large."

    "\n",
    "## 2.Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when it is arranged in numerical order. It is not affected by extreme values and is more appropriate for skewed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.Mode: The mode is the most frequent value in a dataset. It is useful for nominal and ordinal data and is often used to describe categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Measures of variability describe how spread out the data is around the central value. The three most common measures of variability are:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.Range: The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset. It provides a simple and intuitive measure of variability but is highly sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.Variance: The variance measures how much the individual values in a dataset deviate from the mean. It is calculated by summing the squared differences between each value and the mean, and then dividing by the total number of values. The variance is useful for understanding the spread of a dataset, but its value is not easy to interpret as it is in squared units.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.Standard deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is a more interpretable measure of variability and is commonly used to describe the spread of a dataset. It is often used to describe continuous data that are roughly normally distributed."
