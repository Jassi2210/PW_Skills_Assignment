        "In this Web Scraping project, Flask is used to create an API endpoint that returns the scraped data in JSON format. The endpoint is defined in a Flask route, which is mapped to a URL path. When the API is requested with a HTTP GET request, the Flask application executes the route function, which in turn calls the web scraping code to extract the data from the target website. The scraped data is then returned to the client in JSON format.\n",
