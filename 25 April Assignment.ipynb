    "Q1. What are Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors? How are they related to the Eigen-Decomposition approach? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans1-Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are a pair of concepts in linear algebra that are related to the eigen-decomposition approach. Eigenvalues represent the scaling factor of eigenvectors in a linear transformation. Eigenvectors are the vectors that maintain their direction after a linear transformation. The eigen-decomposition approach involves decomposing a matrix into a set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. For example, consider the matrix A = [[2, 1], [1, 2]]. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A can be found by solving the equation Av = λv, where λ is an eigenvalue, and v is an eigenvector. The resulting eigenvalues are λ1 = 3, λ2 = 1, and the corresponding eigenvectors are v1 = [1, 1] and v2 = [-1, 1].\n",

    "Q2. What is eigen decomposition and what is its significance in linear algebra?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans2- Eigen decomposition is a process of decomposing a matrix into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. It is significant in linear algebra because it can help to simplify and analyze complex matrices, and it is useful for solving systems of linear equations, diagonalization of matrices, and principal component analysis.\n",

    "Q3. What are the conditions that must be satisfied for a square matrix to be diagonalizable using the Eigen-Decomposition approach? Provide a brief proof to support your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans3-A square matrix is diagonalizable using the eigen-decomposition approach if it has n linearly independent eigenvectors, where n is the dimension of the matrix. This is because a diagonalizable matrix can be expressed as a product of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. In other words, the matrix can be written as A = PDP^-1, where P is a matrix of the eigenvectors, D is a diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues, and P^-1 is the inverse of P. A brief proof of this involves showing that the eigenvectors are linearly independent, and therefore form a basis for the vector space.\n",

    "Q4. What is the significance of the spectral theorem in the context of the Eigen-Decomposition approach? How is it related to the diagonalizability of a matrix? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans4-The spectral theorem states that a matrix is diagonalizable if and only if it is symmetric. This is significant in the context of the eigen-decomposition approach because it provides a condition for when a matrix can be decomposed into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. For example, the matrix A = [[1, 2], [2, 1]] is symmetric and can be diagonalized using the eigen-decomposition approach, with eigenvalues λ1 = 3 and λ2 = -1, and corresponding eigenvectors v1 = [1, -1] and v2 = [1, 1].\n",

    "Q5. How do you find the eigenvalues of a matrix and what do they represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans5- Eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation of a matrix, which is defined as det(A-λI) = 0, where det is the determinant, A is the matrix, λ is the eigenvalue, and I is the identity matrix. Eigenvalues represent the scaling factor of eigenvectors in a linear transformation. In other words, they indicate how much the eigenvector is stretched or shrunk by the linear transformation.\n",

    "Q6. What are eigenvectors and how are they related to eigenvalues?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans6-Eigenvectors are the vectors that maintain their direction after a linear transformation. They are related to eigenvalues because they are scaled by the eigenvalue in the linear transformation. Specifically, the equation Av = λv means that multiplying the matrix A by the eigenvector v results in a new vector that is scaled by the eigenvalue λ.\n",

    "Q7. Can you explain the geometric interpretation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans7-The geometric interpretation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues involves the idea of linear transformations. Eigenvectors are the vectors that are transformed by a matrix in a way that preserves their direction. Eigenvalues represent the scaling factor of these eigenvectors in the transformation. For example, if a matrix is scaled uniformly along all eigenvectors, then the eigenvalues will be the same for all eigenvectors. If a matrix stretches one eigenvector more than others, then the corresponding eigenvalue will be larger.\n",

    "* Image compression: Eigen decomposition can be used to reduce the dimensionality of an image by finding the principal components that capture the most important information. This is useful for image compression, where the reduced dimensionality image can be stored more efficiently.\n",
    "* Network analysis: Eigen decomposition can be used to analyze the structure of a network by finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix. This helps to identify important nodes or clusters within the network.\n",
    "* Quantum mechanics: Eigen decomposition is extensively used in quantum mechanics to solve the Schrödinger equation and obtain the energy levels of a quantum system.\n",

    "Q9. Can a matrix have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans9-Yes, a matrix can have multiple sets of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. However, each set of eigenvectors corresponds to a unique set of eigenvalues. This means that if a matrix has two sets of eigenvectors, they will correspond to two different sets of eigenvalues.\n",
