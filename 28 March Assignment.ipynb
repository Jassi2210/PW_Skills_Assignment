    "Ans1. Ridge Regression is a type of regularized linear regression technique that adds a penalty term to the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. The penalty term is added to the sum of the squared values of the regression coefficients, which helps to constrain the size of the coefficients. The key difference between Ridge Regression and OLS is that Ridge Regression shrinks the coefficient estimates towards zero, whereas OLS does not."

The aim is to find the value of lambda that minimizes the test error while avoiding overfitting. One common approach is to use k-fold cross-validation, where the data is divided into k subsets or folds. The model is trained on k-1 of the folds and tested on the remaining fold, and this process is repeated k times. The average test error across all k iterations is used to select the optimal value of lambda."
