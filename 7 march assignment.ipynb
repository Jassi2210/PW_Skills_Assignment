    "## Ans2- The mean is the arithmetic average of a set of data, and it is calculated by adding up all the values in the dataset and dividing by the total number of values. The mean is sensitive to outliers and can be heavily influenced by extreme values in the dataset.\n",

    "## The median is the middle value in a dataset when the data are arranged in order of magnitude. If there is an even number of values, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle values.

    "## All three measures of central tendency are used to describe the center of a dataset, but the appropriate measure to use depends on the nature of the data and the research question being addressed. For example, if the data are normally distributed and do not contain outliers, the mean may be the best measure of central tendency. However, if the data are skewed or contain outliers, the median may be a better representation of the center of the dataset. Similarly, if the data are nominal or categorical, the mode may be the most appropriate measure of central tendency."

A positive covariance indicates that the two variables are positively related, while a negative covariance indicates that they are negatively related.

A correlation coefficient of 0 indicates no correlation. Correlation is widely used in statistical analysis to identify relationships between variables and to make predictions based on those relationships."

    "\n",
    "## In terms of measures of central tendency, outliers can pull the mean in their direction, making it an inaccurate representation of the \"typical\" value of the dataset. For example, consider a dataset of incomes of individuals in a small town where most people earn around 50,000 per year, but one individual earns 1 million per year. In this case, the mean income will be significantly skewed by the outlier, and it will no longer be a good representation of the typical income in the town.\n",

    "## On the other hand, the median is less affected by outliers since it only considers the middle value in the dataset. So, the median is often used when the dataset contains outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## In terms of measures of dispersion, outliers can greatly affect the range and standard deviation of the dataset. Range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset, and if there is an outlier that is much larger or smaller than the rest of the data, it can greatly increase the range. Similarly, the standard deviation is sensitive to outliers and can be significantly affected by them. This is because the standard deviation is a measure of how much the data deviates from the mean, and outliers can cause the data to deviate significantly from the mean.\n",

    "## For example, consider a dataset of the weights of students in a class where most students weigh around 130-150 pounds, but one student weighs 300 pounds. In this case, the range and standard deviation of the dataset will be greatly affected by the outlier, making them less useful measures of dispersion.\n",
