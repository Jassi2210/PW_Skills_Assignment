    "Q1. What is Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "A1. Random Forest Regressor is a machine learning algorithm used for regression tasks. It is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make more accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. How does Random Forest Regressor reduce the risk of overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "A2. Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting by using bootstrap aggregating (bagging) and random feature selection. Bagging involves training each decision tree on a random subset of the training data, and random feature selection involves selecting a random subset of features to use for each decision tree. These techniques help to reduce the variance and increase the generalization performance of the model.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How does Random Forest Regressor aggregate the predictions of multiple decision trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "A3. Random Forest Regressor aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees by taking the average (for regression tasks) of the predictions made by each individual tree. Each decision tree is trained on a different subset of the data and features, and therefore makes slightly different predictions. By averaging the predictions of multiple trees, the final prediction is more stable and less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What are the hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "A4. The hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor include the number of trees (n_estimators), the maximum depth of each tree (max_depth), the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node (min_samples_split), the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node (min_samples_leaf), and the maximum number of features to consider when looking for the best split (max_features), among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is the difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "A5. The main difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor is that Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees, while Decision Tree Regressor uses only a single decision tree. Random Forest Regressor is less prone to overfitting and generally has higher accuracy than Decision Tree Regressor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "A6. The advantages of Random Forest Regressor include high accuracy, resistance to overfitting, and ability to handle a large number of input features. The disadvantages include being computationally intensive, difficulty in interpreting the model, and potential loss of information due to the averaging of predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What is the output of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "A7. The output of Random Forest Regressor is a continuous numerical value, which is the predicted value of the regression target variable for a given set of input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Can Random Forest Regressor be used for classification tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "A8. Yes, Random Forest Regressor can also be used for classification tasks by changing the loss function and decision rule used by the individual decision trees. In this case, the output is a categorical variable indicating the predicted class for a given set of input features.\n",
