    "## Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with an example.\n",
    "## Ans1- Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are mathematical functions that describe the probability distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Probability Mass Function (PMF) is used for discrete random variables and gives the probability that a random variable takes on a specific value. It is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. For example, consider a six-sided die. The PMF of rolling a 1 is 1/6, as there is only one favorable outcome out of six possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## On the other hand, Probability Density Function (PDF) is used for continuous random variables and gives the probability density at a specific point. It is the area under the curve of the function between two points on the x-axis. For example, consider the height of adult males in a population. The PDF of the height of adult males may follow a normal distribution, with the peak of the curve at the mean height, and the probability density at any specific height is the area under the curve between two values on the x-axis."

    "## For a continuous random variable, the CDF is the integral of the probability density function (PDF) over the range from negative infinity to x. The formula for CDF of a continuous random variable is given as:\n",

It is a continuous probability distribution that describes a wide range of natural phenomena, such as the distribution of heights or weights of people in a population, the distribution of test scores, and many other phenomena.

The probability of success is denoted by p, and the probability of failure by q=1-p.\n",
