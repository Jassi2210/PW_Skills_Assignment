    "Q1. What is an ensemble technique in machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans1- An ensemble technique in machine learning is a method of combining multiple models to improve the accuracy and robustness of the final prediction. The idea behind ensemble techniques is to use the collective knowledge of several models to make better predictions than any single model could do alone. Ensemble methods can be applied to a wide range of machine learning problems, including classification, regression, and clustering."

    "Q2. Why are ensemble techniques used in machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans2- Ensemble techniques are used in machine learning because they offer several advantages over individual models. Firstly, ensemble methods can reduce the variance of the final predictions, which can improve the accuracy and stability of the model. Secondly, ensemble methods can help to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, resulting in poor generalization to new data. By combining multiple models, ensemble methods can reduce the likelihood of overfitting and produce more generalizable models. Finally, ensemble methods can be used to combine the strengths of different models and overcome their weaknesses, resulting in better overall performance."

    "\n",
    "Ans3- Bagging (short for Bootstrap Aggregation) is an ensemble technique in machine learning that involves training multiple models on different random subsets of the training data, and then combining the predictions of these models to make the final prediction. The subsets of the training data are selected randomly with replacement, meaning that some samples may appear in multiple subsets, while others may not appear at all. The final prediction is typically made by taking the average (in regression problems) or the majority vote (in classification problems) of the predictions of the individual models."

    "Ans4- Boosting is another ensemble technique in machine learning that involves training multiple models sequentially, with each subsequent model focusing on the samples that were misclassified by the previous models. The idea behind boosting is to iteratively improve the performance of the model by emphasizing the difficult samples that are more likely to be misclassified. Boosting can be applied to a wide range of machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines."

In some cases, individual models may be sufficient to achieve good performance, while in other cases, ensemble methods may be necessary to achieve the desired level of accuracy and robustness."

    "Q8. How does bootstrap work and What are the steps involved in bootstrap?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans8- Bootstrap is a statistical technique for estimating the sampling distribution of a statistic by generating multiple resamples (bootstrap samples) from the original data. The basic idea behind bootstrap is to use the resampled data to estimate the variability of a statistic, such as the mean or standard deviation, when the population distribution is unknown or cannot be assumed to be normal. The bootstrap method is widely used in machine learning and statistics for building robust models, estimating uncertainty, and testing hypotheses.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Repeat steps 2-5 for a large number of iterations to obtain a more accurate estimate of the population parameter and its variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind bootstrap is that the resampling procedure generates a set of independent and identically distributed (iid) samples from the original data, which can be used to estimate the distribution of a statistic. By generating many bootstrap samples and calculating the statistic of interest for each sample, we can obtain an empirical distribution of the statistic and estimate its variance and other properties. The bootstrap method is particularly useful when the sample size is small or the population distribution is non-normal or unknown, as it provides a non-parametric approach to statistical inference."
