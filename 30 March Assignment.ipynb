    "Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression technique that combines the L1 and L2 regularization methods of Lasso and Ridge Regression, respectively. It is used to handle high-dimensional datasets with a large number of features and multicollinearity, which can cause overfitting. Elastic Net Regression differs from other regression techniques in that it simultaneously considers the advantages of Lasso and Ridge Regression. This combination allows it to select a subset of relevant features while also shrinking the coefficients of the remaining features to zero or close to zero."

    "\n",
    "A: The optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression can be chosen using cross-validation techniques. The hyperparameters alpha and l1_ratio, which control the amount of L1 and L2 regularization, respectively, are tuned using a grid search or a random search. The optimal values are chosen based on the best performance on the validation set."

    "\n",
    "A: The coefficients in Elastic Net Regression can be interpreted similarly to other regression techniques. They represent the change in the dependent variable for a unit change in the corresponding independent variable, holding all other variables constant. If a coefficient is positive, it indicates a positive relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable, while a negative coefficient indicates a negative relationship. The magnitude of the coefficient represents the strength of the relationship."

Another method is to use advanced imputation techniques, such as k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) imputation or multiple imputation. Additionally, Elastic Net Regression can also handle missing values in the input data directly by assigning missing values as 0 or imputing them as the mean of the corresponding feature."
