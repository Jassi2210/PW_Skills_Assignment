    "Ans1. R-squared (RÂ²) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s) in a linear regression model. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit of the model to the data. R-squared is calculated by dividing the sum of squared differences between the predicted and actual values by the total sum of squares of the dependent variable. In other words, it measures the percentage of the total variation in the dependent variable that is accounted for by the independent variable(s)."

They provide a quantitative measure of the accuracy of the model's predictions and can be used to compare the performance of different models. However, there are also some disadvantages to using these metrics. They are sensitive to outliers and can be skewed by extreme values in the data. Additionally, they do not provide information about the direction of the errors, such as whether the model tends to overestimate or underestimate the actual values. As such, it is often useful to use a combination of these metrics along with visualizations to get a more complete understanding of the model's performance."

This penalty term is the absolute value of the coefficients multiplied by a regularization parameter, which determines the strength of the penalty. Lasso regularization is different from Ridge regularization in that it shrinks the coefficients of less important features to zero, effectively performing feature selection. Lasso is more appropriate when there are many irrelevant or redundant features in the dataset and we want to select only the most important ones."

This helps to reduce the complexity of the model and prevents it from fitting too closely to the training data, which can result in poor performance on new, unseen data. For example, in a linear regression model with many features, regularized linear models such as Ridge or Lasso regularization can be used to reduce the impact of less important features and improve the generalization performance of the model."
